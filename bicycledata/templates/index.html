      <p>Unlocking Safer Urban Cycling</p>
    </header>
    <p>Welcome to our webpage dedicated to collecting measurements
    from bicycles in urban areas! Our platform gathers valuable data
    that provides insight into how motor vehicles behave in shared
    spaces with bicycles. By analyzing these measurements, we aim to
    enhance safety for cyclists and promote a harmonious coexistence
    between bicycles and motor vehicles in urban environments. Join us
    in our mission to make traffic safer and more accommodating for
    cyclists through data-driven solutions.
